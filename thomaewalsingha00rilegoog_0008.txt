¹ The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finishcd, the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen hythe
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, altera careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute‚ dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangernenta
without unneeessary expense.”

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that

each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct·
neas the text of each writer, derived from aeollation of the
best Mss, and ‘that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. T hey
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed hythe
Master of the Rolls, a biographieal account of the author,
sofar as authentic materials existed sor that purpose, and
an estimate ol his historical eredibility aud value.
