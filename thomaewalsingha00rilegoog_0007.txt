submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication

of materials for the History of this Country srom the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reigu of Henry VIII.

should be selected for publication under competent editors ,
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·

ment, without mutilation or abridgmeut, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scaroe and valuable.

to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged onan Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
aceruate collation of the best MSS.

of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work abrief
account of the life and times of the author, aud any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but. no other
note or comment was to bc allowed, except what might he
