Volnme, or its immediate sources, und not the Saint
Alban’s Compiler to the continuator, from the internal
evidence afforded, there seems to be little room for
doubt. ·
The original portions in the reign of Edward ΙΙΙ.
that are borrowed by Walsingham from the Saint
Alban's Chronicle, or, in other words, those parts of
its text for which the original authorities appear to
be at present unascertained, will be found, in longer or
shorter passages (denoted by the side-notes), between
peges 221 and 328. The few original insertions of
Walsingham's own, are short passages in peges 197,
200, 221, 222, and 228.

History of which ends at 1392. How far that oom-
pilation has been indebted for the history of these
years to contemporary sources of information, common
to itself and other Chronieles of the same period, will
be a subjectos enquiry in the Second Volume. For the

from some common source, will probably be found to
receive confirmation, from the ascertained fact that
the Historia Rimrdt', like Walsinghem's History, is
borrowed to a considerable extent from the Saint
Alban's Manuscript, Bibl. Reg. 13 E. ix.; tho former
extracting from it matter that Walsinghom has
omitted, and omitting much more that Walsingham
has transcribed.
