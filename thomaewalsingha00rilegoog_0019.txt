Tne present Volnme contains the earlier part of the
dupli-eh Historp of Thomas Walsingham, Monk of
Saint Albane, hl). 1272 to ΑΒ. 1381: the remaining
portion os the work will appear in the sucoeeding
Volnme.

¹ The Euplialt Historp os Walsingham was first Previom s
¹ published in the year 1574, under the auspices, ifffifflf
not the immediate supervision, of Matthew Parker, ham’s His·
Arehbishop of Canterbury3 and it again appeared, as ‘ml‘
port of the Applico, Normoouieo, Hibemtico, Cuna-
hrioa, u Veteribus scripto, os Willium Oamden, pub-
lished at Frankfort (folio) in 1603. ,Tae typography
of Parker's text is very instauratam the transcriber
of the manuscript from which it is derived, whoever
he (or they) may have heen, lias done the work of
extension no better. ·Oamden's version is hardly a less
unfavourable specimen of .p1inting‚ in point of accu-
racy, than Parker’s ; perhaps more so. ,The Arch-
bishop’e Volume, however, vwhether¹ by itself, or in
combination with his edition oi Asser's Life of Alfrcd,
now sells at a high price; ¹as being a book rarity, no
doubt: Oamden's work, though a much larger volume,
is more moderate in price, though considerably in
exoess of a sum which any but the wealthy or
enthusiastic book-collector would willingly afford.

The text of the present Edition is taken from a small Textofthe

folio Manuseript, No. VIL in the Arundel Collection, in ΡΜ

Edition.
